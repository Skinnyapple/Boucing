I only had one class, but it still felt more organized. I didn't have to write a BouncingTriangle function for every single triangle I wanted there to be.


Project reflection: Most of this is pretty straightforward; the only part I had a hard time with was trying to figure out how to make them bounce off each other. I used radius to determine whether or not they should bounce, but sometimes they do get stuck if they appear too close to each other.
